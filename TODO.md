Investigate OG author's TODO list

- [ ] New Plugins
    + [ ] [zbirenbaum/copilot-cmp: Lua plugin to turn github copilot into a cmp source](https://github.com/zbirenbaum/copilot-cmp)
    + [ ] [GitHub - numToStr/Navigator.nvim](https://github.com/numToStr/Navigator.nvim)

- FZF
    + [ ] He had a lot of fzf features
        * In parallel to telescope it seems
        * He may have only been using fzf with telescope plugin
        * Research / test pros and cons
        * Stick with Telescope only until there is time for this
            - Maybe don't consider if it seem imported features cover
            - Read code to eval

    + If FZF viable author had this on roadmap
        * [ ] FzfLua Send all to QuickFix List
